# mental-health-powerbi-dashboard

This project analyzes mental health care indicators in the United States during 4 weeks in 2020 using an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The purpose of this dashboard is to measure the difference between mental health needs and access to treatment, identify states with unmet needs, and compare the behavior across demographic groups, providing a clear, visual report showing where mental health support was lacking.

The dashboard explores:
- Therapy Received (%)
- Therapy Needed but Not Received (%)
- Medication Taken (%)
- Treatment Gap (%) – unmet mental health need

Key Features:
- Trend line chart across time
- KPI Gauge for Treatment Gap
- Top 10 states with the highest gap
- Azure Map
- Slicers for Group, Subgroup, and State
- Custom DAX measures for accurate percentages

Files Included:
- .pbix – Power BI report
- .pdf – dashboard export
- .csv – dataset
- /screenshots – images of the report

Tools Used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX

The analysis shows that several U.S. states experienced a noticeable Treatment Gap (%), meaning people needed mental health care but did not receive it. The highest gaps were found in states such as Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Utah, indicating significant unmet mental health needs.

Conclusion:
- Medication use was consistently higher than therapy use.
- Females reported higher therapy rates than males.
- Younger age groups showed the most engagement with mental health services.
- The national treatment gap remained small but present, showing that access to mental health care was not evenly distributed across demographic groups or states.
