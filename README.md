# mental-health-powerbi-dashboard

This project analyzes mental health care indicators in the United States during 2020 using an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The main goal is to understand:
- How many people received mental health care
- How many needed care but did not receive it
- How many took prescription medication
- What the overall Treatment Gap (%) looks like
The dataset is from data.gov: "Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks"

The purpose of this dashboard is to measure the difference between mental health needs and access to treatment, identify states with unmet needs, and compare the behavior across demographic groups.
Final goal:
Provide a clear, visual report showing where mental health support was lacking during 4 weeks in 2020 and which groups were most affected.

The dashboard explores:
- Therapy Received (%)
- Therapy Needed but Not Received (%)
- Medication Taken (%)
- Treatment Gap (%) – unmet mental health need

Key Features:
- Trend line chart across time
- KPI Gauge for Treatment Gap
- Top 10 states with the highest gap
- Azure Map
- Slicers for Group, Subgroup, and State
- Custom DAX measures for accurate percentages
